Discovered after the war, the unfinished work, with no soundtrack, Film Forum is proud to present Yael Hersonski's A FILM UNFINISHED, having its U.S. theatrical premiere on Wednesday, August 18. Since the end of WWII, one copy of a 60-minute (unfinished) propaganda film, shot by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto in May 1942 (a year prior to the uprising), labeled simply \"Ghetto,\" sat undisturbed in an East German archive. A FILM UNFINISHED presents the entire film, both documentary and fictionalized sequences (e.g. dozens of Jewish patrons at an elegant restaurant; a luxurious funeral cortege). It includes a revealing interview with Willy Wist, the only cinematographer identified with the production (himself caught onscreen in his SS uniform), as well as scenes in which now-elderly former residents of the Warsaw Ghetto, reviewing the footage, occasionally recognize their neighbors, or report upon the filmmakers' efforts to stage fantasies of affluence and well-being, or of Jews treating their less fortunate compatriots with callous disdain. This is a film of enormous import: it documents conditions under which ghetto residents lived and the efforts (however imperfect) of the perpetrators to recast this reality to suggest an entirely different scenario. A FILM UNFINISHED is presented with support from the Joan S. Constantiner Fund for Jewish and Holocaust Film. -- (C) Film Forum", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/film_unfinished/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770859186/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770859186/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770859186.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770859186/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/14/98/11149872_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/14/98/11149872_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/14/98/11149872_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/14/98/11149872_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770859186", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 97, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 86}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1422153"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-01-01", "theater": "2010-08-18"}}

The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road.

The shooters, it seems, originally intended to kill Nasri's younger brother, Omar (Shahir Kabaha), in lieu of the cousin. Abu Elias (Youssef Sahwani), a restaurateur and respected member of the community, steps in to negotiate. Omar agrees to make a cash payment to the gangsters to prevent further violence, but since he doesn't have the money, he raises it by dealing drugs. Abu has a daughter, Hadir (Ranin Karim), who works at his restaurant; she's fallen in love with Omar, but since she's Christian and he's Muslim, they can't acknowledge their feelings in public. Also working at the restaurant is Malek (Ibrahim Frege), a 16-year-old illegal immigrant who is looking for any kind of job to help pay for his mother's medical treatments. And elsewhere, Dando (Eran Naim) is a policeman drawn into the chaotic life of Binj (Scandar Copti), a suspected drug dealer who has been arrested for attacking a Jewish neighbor; Dando is also preoccupied with the fate of his brother, who has suddenly gone missing.

Kind-hearted, fun-loving, and utterly without purpose, Arthur spends every day in the heedless pursuit of amusement.

Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) has it all - looks, intelligence, wealth and opportunity - and a wicked cruel streak. Prone to mocking and humiliating \"aggressively unattractive\" classmates, he zeroes in on Goth classmate Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen), inviting her to the school's extravagant environmental bash. Kendra accepts, and, true to form, Kyle blows her off in a particularly savage fashion. She retaliates by casting a spell that physically transforms him into everything he despises. Enraged by his horrible and unrecognizable appearance he confronts Kendra and learns that the only solution to the curse is to find someone that will love him as he is - a task he considers impossible. Repulsed by his appearance, Kyle's callous father (Peter Krause) banishes him to Brooklyn with a sympathetic housekeeper (LisaGay Hamilton) and blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris). As Kyle ponders how to overcome the curse and get his old life back, he chances upon a drug addict in the act of killing a threatening dealer. Seizing the opportunity, Kyle promises the addict freedom and safety for his daughter Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) if she will consent to live in Kyle's Brooklyn home. Thus begins Kyle's journey to discover true love in this hyper-modern retelling of the classic \"Beauty and the Beast\" story.

Because of the sexualinnuendo and the barely-there costumes it has largely been left out of the history books.In the 1840s burlesque was applied to a wide range of comedic plays that entertained the lower and middleclasses in Great Britain. Coming to America, burlesque evolved into shows performed by scantily-cladbeauties. It thrived, appealing to the masses of working class people who weekly stormed the theatres tosee troupes like \"The British Blondes\", a bevy of beauties dressed in tights. Burlesque poked fun at theupper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of obtaining sex. By the 1920sthe old burlesque circuits closed and strip tease was introduced to offer something vaudeville and film didnot.During the Great Depression, for a dime a man could fall into a big gaudy burlesque show and forget histroubles. From theatres to nightclubs, burlesque was a raucous sexy show filled with gorgeous women,strippers, comedians, acrobats and singers. The tame by today's standards, the shows were consideredrisque, and most performers were looked down on as second rate.Backed by public outrage, in 1937 New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed the burlesque houses in hisstate. The use of the word \"burlesque\" was outlawed in advertising. The Minsky brothers, who some sayintroduced nudity to the burly audiences, were so closely associated with burlesque that La Guardia bannedthe use of the name Minsky. Once again, burlesque changed, moving across the river to New Jersey toescape censure. Eventually comedians and musicians' parts were reduced in the shows and more stripperswere brought on. By the 1960s hard-core porn was available and burlesque had died. But what happened tothe thousands of performers? Where did they go?\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the behind-the-scenes stories of these men and women as told by the performersthemselves. For the first time ever, the performers from the golden age of burlesque relate theirheartbreaking, triumphant stories of life on the road performing in the burly circuit. Many were ashamed oftheir past and had never talked about their experiences. Just as many had never been asked.Director Leslie Zemeckis and producer Sheri Hellard traveled extensively across the country from theBayous of post-Katrina Mississippi, to New Jersey, Florida and all points between. The duo tracked downand recorded dozens of interviews with little-known performers to the last of the living legends ofburlesque. They spoke with relatives of many deceased stars. The men and women in this documentaryopened their scrapbooks as well as their hearts, relating memories they had all but forgotten.Amongst those interviewed were former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, funny men andwomen, authors and historians assembled together for the first time ever to tell you just what reallyhappened in a burlesque show. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this theirlast, and often times only interview. We dedicate this film to their memory.\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday. Funny, shocking,unbelievable and heartbreaking, their stories will touch your hearts. Hear the performers in their ownwords. See the performers in action. We invite you to peek behind the curtain at the burly show. -- (C) First Run Features", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/behind_the_burly_q/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873084/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873084/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873084.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873084/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/96/11129615_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/96/11129615_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/96/11129615_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/96/11129615_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770873084", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 78, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 63}, "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1510907"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-04-11", "theater": "2010-04-23"}}

But when a surprise tuition bill threatens his dream of law school and leaves him thousands of dollars in the hole, he's forced to think outside the box. Convincing his three roommates they can make a killing exploiting the gullible church crowd, the guys start a sham charity and begin campaigning across the country, raising funds for a cause as fake as their message.

But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official Site", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_swan_2010/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770738135/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/18/91/11189196_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/18/91/11189196_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/18/91/11189196_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/18/91/11189196_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770738135", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 87, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 84}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "0947798"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-03-29", "theater": "2010-12-03"}}

As Ultima inspires Antonio to question authority and see the world from a new perspective, the young boy witnesses a series of seemingly impossible events that have a profound impact on his concepts of divinity and fate. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bless_me_ultima_2012/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771315852/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771315852/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771315852.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771315852/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168991_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168991_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168991_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168991_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771315852", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 71, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 74}, "year": 2013, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1390398"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2013-09-17", "theater": "2013-02-22"}}

When he is unavoidably delayed, he sends his friend Tareq (Alexander Siddig), who had been his security officer for many years, to escort her throughout the beautiful and exotic city. The last thing anyone expects is that they will fall in love. Cairo Time is a love letter to a city intertwined with a love story about a woman. It began when Syrian-Canadian writer/director Ruba Nadda first visited Cairo with her family many years ago. Returning a decade ago with one of her sisters, (and no longer under the protective eye of her father) they had memorable adventures. \"The city was beautiful and the people were beautiful,\" Nadda recalled. Having lived in Damascus, and subsequently traveled the world, Nadda never forgot the grandeur and the chaos of this ancient city that was originally settled in Paleolithic times. Sitting at the border of what was once Upper and Lower Egypt, the area that was to become the metropolis of Cairo has played host to the Greeks, Romans, Crusaders, the Ottomans, Napoleon, and the British and is now one of the most densely populated cities in the world. \"I remember the city being alive. It's gritty and historical and seething with humanity and I just had to capture it on screen.\" Truly, a journey through Cairo is a journey through time and it awakens your soul. It was during Nadda's many trips to international film festivals with her 14 short films and her previous feature, Sabah, that she came to appreciate the feelings of introspection and melancholy that traveling alone engenders. From these experiences came Cairo Time, something Nadda deems a \"real love story, but one that is very un-West because to me the West is about acquiring, accomplishing, deadlines and running, running, running. The central character, Juliette, is suddenly forced to slow down and move on Cairo time.\" This film has a West-meets-East quality to the unexpected, unrequited love between an Arab man and a North American woman. It's also a throw to old style, classic films reminiscent of the restrained, emotional tension in the work of Jane Austen. Juliette is a woman who married young and still ardently loves her husband, Mark, who works abroad. Their children have grown up and moved away. Life, doing what it usually does to a marriage, has replaced their hopes and dreams with accomplishment and responsibilities. In the back of her head, Juliette had thought that sooner or later, she and her husband would have time for each other, which was the reason for her trip to Cairo. \"I love this woman,\" explained Nadda. \"She is quiet. And she has a sadness that's just under the surface which comes from a lifetime of being by herself a lot because she's been stood up by a husband whose work has often taken priority.\" Unable to meet Juliette when she lands, but knowing that she is an independent woman who is likely to head off on her own, Mark asks Tareq to care for her. For years, Mark had trusted Tareq with his own life, so it made sense to extend that trust to Juliette's wellbeing. Once at the hotel, Juliette is alone again. Unwilling to wait quietly for her husband's arrival, every effort she makes to venture out on her own is rebuffed. Cairo is not a gentle city. With a population of 17 million, the noise is unbearable. The heat, mixed with dust, is oppressive. Traffic does not adhere to lanes or stop lights. And women, particularly foreigners, do not easily move about in public alone. Quickly, Juliette learns that the simple activities of everyday living in Canada, like walking across the street, become a test of wills in Cairo. And so she turns to Tareq who shows her first, Cairo, and then herself. -- (C) Official Site", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cairo_time/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817176/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817176/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817176.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817176/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/90/11169076_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/90/11169076_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/90/11169076_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/90/11169076_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770817176", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 81, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 62}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "0896529"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-11-30", "theater": "2010-08-06"}}

He plays in the same game as the highest of rollers and resorts to awe-inspiring levels of conning, scheming and fraudulent antics to get what he wants. Inspired by true events that are too over-the-top for even the wildest imaginations to conjure, CASINO JACK lays bare the wild excesses and escapades of Jack Abramoff. Aided by his business partner Michael Scanlon (Barry Pepper), Jack parlays his clout over some of the world's most powerful men with the goal of creating a personal empire of wealth and influence. When the two enlist a mob-connected buddy (Jon Lovitz) to help with one of their illegal schemes, they soon find themselves in over their heads, entrenched in a world of mafia assassins, murder and a scandal that spins so out of control that it makes worldwide headlines. Directed by George Hickenlooper (FACTORY GIRL, THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS), CASINO JACK returns Spacey to the type of role that made him famous - a cool-headed, articulate snake charmer whose wild ambitions knows no limits or boundaries.

One morning, a busy London market is decimated by an explosion. In the manhunt that follows, only one member of the suspected terrorist cell survives: Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto), who is arrested and jailed. Preparations begin for what promises to be the trial of the century. But there's a hitch: the government will use classified evidence to prosecute Erdogan, evidence so secret that neither he nor his lawyers can be allowed to see it. Hence the need for the Attorney General (Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent) to appoint a Special Advocate, an additional government-approved defense lawyer (Claudia Simmons-Howe, played by Golden Globe Award nominee Rebecca Hall), one who has clearance to see classified evidence and who can argue for its full disclosure when the trial moves to \"closed\" session. The rules for the Special Advocate are clear: once the secret evidence is shared with her, Claudia will not be allowed to communicate even with the defendant or with other members of the defense team. But just as the case is on the eve of going to trial, Erdogan's lawyer dies suddenly, and a new defense attorney, Martin Rose (Eric Bana), quickly steps in. Martin is tenacious, driven, and brilliant - and an ex-lover of Claudia's. The two lawyers make an uncomfortable pact to keep their former affair hidden. But as Martin begins to piece the case together, the outlines of a sinister conspiracy emerge, one that will draw him and Claudia dangerously close again.

With Copperhead, director Ron Maxwell, who with Gettysburg and Gods and Generals established himself as our foremost cinematic interpreter of the American Civil War, takes on the War from a stunning, unexpected and richly, unforgettably humanist angle.

But should Jonah get the opportunity to make his dark sacrifice, he will become the most powerful man alive and all of humanity will suffer. Unfortunately for Milton, the cops are quickly closing in, and the Devil's determined minion, \"The Accountant\" (William Fichtner), will stop at nothing to drag him back down to Hell.

Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/easy-a/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813310/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813310/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813310.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813310/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/36/11173662_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/36/11173662_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/36/11173662_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/36/11173662_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770813310", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 85, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 77}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1282140"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-12-21", "theater": "2010-09-17"}}

Smart, dreamy, independent and willing to stand up for what she believes in, Juli (Madeline Carroll) is different from anyone else he knows and, frankly, it's a little overwhelming. What's a guy supposed to do when a girl tells him his hair smells like watermelon or wants him to sit in a tree for the spectacular view? There's just no telling what Juli will do next, and Bryce is one guy who'd rather be safe than sorry. Though disappointed by Bryce's unwillingness to see things her way, or even to see the things in life she finds most meaningful, Juli continues to give her potential dreamboat the benefit of the doubt. Until those doubts stack up so high that she finally thinks maybe she was wrong about him. It's just about the same time Bryce starts to think maybe he was wrong about her, too. But is he too late?

Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins \"coaching\" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy.

Not sure what it is, he takes it as a sign to get a head start on his resolutions: being a better son to his mother (Octavia Spencer), whose birthday falls on New Year's Eve, being a better partner to his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz), who he hasn't been completely honest with as of late, and being a better father to Tatiana (Ariana Neal), their beautiful four year-old daughter. Crossing paths with friends, family, and strangers, Oscar starts out well, but as the day goes on, he realizes that change is not going to come easily. His resolve takes a tragic turn, however, when BART officers shoot him in cold blood at the Fruitvale subway stop on New Year's Day.

Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words \"God Is Dead\" on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that \"God Is Dead,\" he must prove God's existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of God's existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? Wouldn't it just be easier just to write \"God Is Dead\" and put the whole incident behind him? GOD'S NOT DEAD weaves together multiple stories of faith, doubt and disbelief, culminating in a dramatic call to action.

Murawski and wife/partner Chris Innis won Best Film Editing Oscars for their work on THE HURT LOCKER the same week that GONE WITH THE POPE premiered at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. --&copy; Official Site", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gone_with_the_pope/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771107411/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771107411/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771107411.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771107411/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/13/17/11131774_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/13/17/11131774_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/13/17/11131774_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/13/17/11131774_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771107411", "ratings": {"audience_score": 54, "critics_score": -1, "audience_rating": "Spilled"}, "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1617250"}, "release_dates": {"theater": "2010-06-04"}}

A onetime Baghdad bureau chief of the Washington Post, Chandrasekaran was present as American forces attempted to set up a provisional government on the grounds surrounding former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's opulent palace. The resulting governing body, according to critics, existed in a bubble so far-removed from the grim realities of the Iraq War that it failed to properly assess the needs of the people. In this fictional thriller set during the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad, director Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland use Chandrasekaran's journalistic account as the foundation for the story of an officer who joins forces with a senior CIA officer to unearth evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is certain that Hussein has been stockpiling WMDs in the Iraqi desert, but in their race from one empty site to the next, they soon stumble across evidence of an elaborate cover up. As a result, Miller realizes that operatives on both sides of the conflict are attempting to spin the story in their favor. Now, as Miller searches for answers made ever more elusive by covert and faulty intelligence, the truth becomes the most valuable weapon of all. Will those answers prove pivotal in clearing a rogue regime, or escalate the war in a region that grows increasingly unstable with each passing day? Amy Ryan co-stars as the New York Times foreign correspondent who travels to Iraq investigating the U.S. government's allegations about weapons of mass destruction, with Greg Kinnear appearing in the role of an additional CIA officer, and Antoni Corone essaying the role of a colonel. Brendan Gleeson rounds out the main cast for this Universal Pictures production. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1202804-green_zone/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783634/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783634/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783634.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783634/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171280_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171280_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171280_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/12/11171280_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770783634", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 53, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 57}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "0947810"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-06-22", "theater": "2010-03-12"}}

The film then flashes back briefly to show how Guy's dalliance with Elena (Sandha Khin), an outgoing young woman he met on the subway, caused the breakup. The film follows Guy and Madeline as they try to make their way, post-breakup. Guy continues to play his gigs, though Elena doesn't seem quite as interested in his music as Madeline was. Madeline finds a job at the Summer Shack restaurant, pines for Guy, but eventually decides to leave Boston for New York. Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench features music by Justin Hurwitz and a score recorded by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra. Chazelle, who is also a jazz drummer (he appears briefly in the film), originally made the film as a short for his senior thesis at Harvard, where he studied under documentary filmmaker Robb Moss. Chazelle and his cast and crew worked on the film for three years, as financing permitted, to expand it into a feature. Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, where it was shown in the Discovery section.", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/guy-and-madeline-on-a-park-bench/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808459/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808459/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808459.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808459/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/91/48/10914837_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/91/48/10914837_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/91/48/10914837_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/10/91/48/10914837_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770808459", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 90, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 58}, "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1337193"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-05-03", "theater": "2010-11-05"}}

He spends most of his days in solitude, only getting out to play the occasional game of chess at a nearby pub with his best friend, Leonard (David Bradley). The days of basic human decency seem to be a thing of the past, because in recent years barbarous drug dealers and gangsters have overtaken the dilapidated complex. Killing is a way of life for these young thugs, and as a result overburdened detectives Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles) are essentially relegated to knocking on doors and notifying parents when their children have been killed in the latest fracas, instead of investigating the crimes and jailing the guilty parties.

With her identity in crisis as she attempts to regain her footing in life, Lisa begins dating Matty (Wilson), a Major League Baseball pitcher and notorious womanizer. Meanwhile, terminally honest businessman George (Rudd) finds himself on the road to financial ruin or worse after being wrongly implicated in a financial crime. As George struggles to clear his name and reconcile his turbulent relationship with his father, Charles (Nicholson), a chance meeting with Lisa at the lowest point in both of their lives leaves him optimistic that things may work out after all. Meanwhile, Lisa and George both realize that the only thing that's certain about the future is that we never know what fate has in store for us. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_do_you_know/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201460/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201460/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201460.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201460/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/98/11169897_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/98/11169897_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/98/11169897_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/98/11169897_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771201460", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 32, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 25}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1341188"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-03-22", "theater": "2010-12-17"}}

Edoardo Recchi Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti) is the aging patriarch of a Milanese clan that has amassed a significant fortune over the years through shrewd investments in the textile business. Edoardo Sr. has a beautiful wife, Allegra (Marisa Berenson), and the two have a reliable and dependable son, Tancredi (Pippo Delbono). Years ago, Tancredi met, fell in love with, and then married a woman named Emma (Tilda Swinton) amid a trip to Russia, and brought her back home to Milan; their children include sons Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti) and Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro), and artist daughter Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher). The family gathers for a reunion at Edoardo Sr. and Allegra's villa in Milan, but the happy gathering takes a somber turn when Edoardo suddenly dies not long after having lunch with his family. But the death is far from the only pivotal event that occurs that day: Edoardo Jr. also introduces his mother to a chef, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), with whom he plans to open a restaurant, and Emma finds herself drawn to the culinary artist. Meanwhile, Emma learns that Elisabetta is a lesbian, and though initially startled by this news, she takes the liberation of her daughter as inspiration for her own liberation from confining nuptials. On impulse, Emma travels to San Remo, catches sight of Antonio, and finds herself helplessly drawn to him. Meanwhile, as Emma and Elisabetta undertake their life-changing journeys, all of the men in the Recchi clan outside of Edoardo Jr. feel bound to profit-driven motives -- the commercialism of a class that has long ago shucked responsibility for its workers. This critically acclaimed film constituted Swinton's second collaboration with Guadagnino; they first worked together on the 1999 feature The Protagonists.", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_love/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817666/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817666/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817666.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817666/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/13/10921336_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/13/10921336_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/13/10921336_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/13/10921336_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770817666", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 80, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 68}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1226236"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-10-12", "theater": "2010-06-18"}}

But Jennifer's presence in the small town attracts the attention of a few morally deprived locals who set out one night to teach this city girl a lesson. They break into her cabin to scare her. However, what starts out as terrifying acts of humiliation and intimidation, quickly and uncontrollably escalates into a night of physical abuse and torturous assault. But before they can kill her, Jennifer sacrifices her broken and beaten body to a raging river that washes her away. As time passes, the men slowly stop searching for her body and try to go back to life as usual. But that isn't about to happen. Against all odds, Jennifer Hills survived her ordeal. Now, with hell bent vengeance, Jennifer's sole purpose is to turn the tables on these animals and to inflict upon them every horrifying and torturous moment they carried out on her... only much, much worse. -- (C) Anchor Bay", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_spit_on_your_grave_2010/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040030/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040030/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040030.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040030/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151529_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151529_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151529_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/15/11151529_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771040030", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 34, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 48}, "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1242432"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-02-08", "theater": "2010-10-08"}}

Miles is still rolling with his old friends and colleagues, and the feds are certain he has not fully retired from his criminal past. When Miles meets Vanessa Leon, a woman who is different than every other woman he's met, he is drawn to her beauty and her faith. She is a \"church girl\" in every sense of the word. Increasingly, he is torn between a life that he knows and a love that he feels. As Vanessa experiences his lavish lifestyle, mobster-type friends, gun play, and encounters with past women, Vanessa must reconcile her faith in God and her growing love for Miles. Both are tested to their last ounce of faith and strength in God and each other. God continues to chip away at Miles through struggles from his past, having to live up to his reputation, feelings of unworthiness, the death of his mother, federal charges, his friends being indicted, the strain on his relationship with Vanessa, almost losing her in a near-fatal car accident, and finally the spiritual breakdown that brings him on his knees to face God one-on-one.

But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis.

Shmuel the gunner, Assi the commander, Herzl the loader and Yigal the driver are the tank's crew, four 20-something boys who have never fought in a war and are now operating a killing machine. Though trying to remain brave, the boys are pushed to their mental limits as they struggle to survive in a situation they cannot contain, and try not to lose their humanity in the chaos of war. Writer-director Samuel Maoz's raw and visceral film is based on his own experiences as a twenty year old novice soldier serving in the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon war. Using his own vivid recollections to bring us inside an Israeli tank during the first 24 hours of the invasion, Maoz restricts the film's action entirely to the tank's interior and shows us the outside world only-as the four young soldiers themselves see it-through the lens of a periscopic gun sight. The cathartic process of writing and directing LEBANON allowed Maoz to finally free himself of the events that he had experienced twenty-five years earlier.-- (C) Sony Pictures Classics", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lebanon-2010/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819590/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819590/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819590.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819590/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157351_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157351_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157351_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157351_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770819590", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 90, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 72}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1483831"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-01-18", "theater": "2010-08-06"}}

Megamind was only an infant when his parents loaded him into an emergency escape pod and jettisoned him into space just as their planet was being sucked into a black hole. His destination: planet Earth. Meanwhile, another slightly more wholesome baby sets out on the same trajectory. But while the latter will ultimately land in the home of a wealthy couple and grow up to become Metro Man, hero of Metro City, poor Megamind finds his fate taking the opposite course when his pod crashes in a prison yard, leaving him to be raised by convicts. Later, in grade school, the kids all flock to Metro Man, leaving a frustrated Megamind to embrace a life of diabolical misdeeds. As the years go by, Metro Man and Megamind develop an intense adversarial relationship that pits them in battle over Metro City time and again. Undeterred by his unbroken losing streak, Megamind hatches an ingenious scheme to finally destroy Metro Man by kidnapping pretty reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voice of Tina Fey), and luring the predictable hero into a deadly trap. Then something unexpected happens -- Megamind's plan actually works. Now, with Metro Man out of the picture, Megamind and his Minion (voice of David Cross) stake their claim on Metro City. But what good is ultimate power when you don't even have to fight for it? Realizing that life is simply out of balance without Metro Man to be the hero, Megamind creates a new foe who will be just as righteous and powerful as his fallen adversary. Unfortunately, Megamind's schemes usually have a way of backfiring, and when Metro City's newest savior proves even more evil than Megamind, the blue-hued antihero prepares to fight back with everything he's got. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/megamind/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "posters": {"profile": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177842_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177842_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177842_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177842_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770805424", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 72, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 71}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1001526"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-02-25", "theater": "2010-11-05"}}

Late one night, while watching cricket being played in India on TV, JB comes up with an idea so radical it just might work. Why not go to there and find the next baseball pitching sensation? Setting off for Mumbai with nothing but a gifted but cantankerous scout (Alan Arkin) in tow, JB stages a televised, nationwide competition called \"Million Dollar Arm\" where 40,000 hopefuls compete before two 18-year-old finalists, Rinku and Dinesh (Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal), emerge as winners. JB brings them back to the United States to train with legendary pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton). The goal: get the boys signed to a major league team. Not only is the game itself difficult to master, but life in the U.S. with a committed bachelor makes things even more complicated-for all of them. While Rinku and Dinesh learn the finer points of baseball and American culture, they in turn teach JB the true meaning of teamwork and commitment. Ultimately, what began as a purely commercial venture becomes something more and leads JB to find the one thing he was never looking for at all-a family.

Back in 1964, three men on a mission to register black voters in Mississippi were brutally murdered and buried beneath an earth-filled dam. But the Klansmen who carried out the killings were never brought to trial, despite the fact that they publicly openly boasted about the crime to their friends and families. Flash-forward to 2004, when a group of concerned Neshoba County began turning up the heat to prosecute the perpetrators, who always assumed they'd gotten off scot free. The very next year, 80-year-old Baptist minister Edgar Ray Killen was indicted and brought to trial. As the trial gets under way, Dickoff and Pagano turn their lens on Killen for a series of candid interviews in which the admitted killer reveals why he and other clan members feel that the murder was a justified means of preserving their way of life.

On stage, Donna is unapologetically herself, joking about topics as intimate as her sex life and as crude as her day-old underwear. But when Donna gets dumped, loses her job, and finds herself pregnant just in time for Valentine's Day, she has to navigate the murky waters of independent adulthood for the first time. As she grapples with an uncertain financial future, an unwanted pregnancy, and a surprising new suitor, Donna begins to discover that the most terrifying thing about adulthood isn't facing it all on her own. It's allowing herself to accept the support and love of others. And be truly vulnerable. Never failing to find the comedy and humanity in each awkward situation she encounters, Donna finds out along the way what it means to be as brave in life as she is on stage. Anchored by a breakout performance from Jenny Slate, OBVIOUS CHILD is a winning discovery, packed tight with raw, energetic comedy and moments of poignant human honesty. Writer/Director Gillian Robespierre handles the topic of Donna's unwanted pregnancy with a refreshing matter-of-factness rarely seen onscreen. And with Donna, Slate and Robespierre have crafted a character for the ages - a female audiences will recognize, cheer for, and love.

Syracuse is an alcoholic, and though he's been sober for two years, most of his neighbors still remember him as a embarrassing drunk, while his ex-wife now lives with another man. Syracuse tries to scratch out a living from the ocean and help support his young daughter, Annie (Alison Barry), who suffers from a serious kidney ailment, but good luck is rarely with him until one day, when he pulls up his nets and finds what appears to be a woman caught in them. To Syracuse's surprise, the woman is alive, and he brings her to shore. The woman is a mysterious and secretive type who doesn't want to tell Syracuse anything about herself or be seen by anyone; Annie proposes that she's a selkie, a mythic creature of the sea that can take human form when it falls in love with the right person. Syracuse almost believes that Annie is right, especially after good luck and good fishing begins coming his way after discovering her, but unfortunately the woman Syracuse has named Ondine (Alicja Bachleda) has certain concerns more pressing than the good fortune of her benefactor. Ondine was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ondine/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783567/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783567/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783567.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783567/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/10/11171023_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/10/11171023_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/10/11171023_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/10/11171023_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770783567", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 70, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 60}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1235796"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-09-21", "theater": "2010-06-04"}}

Just eight months ago, they were a happy suburban family with everything they wanted. Now, they are caught in a maze of memory, longing, guilt, recrimination, sarcasm and tightly controlled rage from which they cannot escape. While Becca finds pain in the familiar, Howie finds comfort. <br /><br /> The shifts come in abrupt, unforeseen moments. Becca hesitantly opens up to her opinionated, loving mother (DIANNE WIEST) and secretly reaches out to the teenager involved in the accident that changed everything (MILES TELLER); while Howie lashes out and imagines solace with another woman (SANDRA OH). Yet, as off track as they are, the couple keeps trying to find their way back to a life that still holds the potential for beauty, laughter and happiness. The resulting journey is an intimate glimpse into two people learning to re-engage with each other and a world that has been tilted off its axis. <br /><br /> RABBIT HOLE is directed by John Cameron Mitchell (HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH) from a script by acclaimed playwright David Lindsay-Abaire, adapted from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play.

When Ali lands a job as a bouncer in a nearby nightclub, things quickly start to look up for the itinerant father and son. Then one night, after breaking up a fight in the club, Ali meets the radiant Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), and slips her his number after dropping her off safely at home.

Her spirit broken by the same tragedy that took her legs, Stephanie gradually finds the courage to go on living trough transcendent moments spent with Ali -- a man with precious little pity, but an enormous love of life. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/de_rouille_et_dos_2012/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166900_ori.jpg", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166900_ori.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166900_ori.jpg", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166900_ori.jpg"}, "id": "771303199", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 82, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 79}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2012, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "2053425"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2013-03-19", "theater": "2012-11-23"}}

When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' \"Mary Poppins,\" he made them a promise-one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history. Inspired by true events, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is the extraordinary, untold story of how Disney's classic \"Mary Poppins\" made it to the screen-and the testy relationship that the legendary Walt Disney had with author P.L. Travers that almost derailed it.

The cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead of Holmes as he spins a web of death and destruction-all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history. -- (C) Warner Bros", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sherlock_holmes_a_game_of_shadows/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201645/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201645/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201645.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771201645/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/54/11165486_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/54/11165486_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/54/11165486_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/54/11165486_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771201645", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Fresh", "critics_score": 60, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 77}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2011, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1515091"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2012-06-12", "theater": "2011-12-16"}}

Maintaining your fierce public persona is no simple task when you're juggling infants and changing diapers, so when Shrek realizes that nobody is afraid of him anymore he recruits mischief-maker Rumpelstiltskin to restore his once-mighty roar. Unfortunately for Shrek, that plan hits an unexpected hitch. As a result, the morose monster takes a trip into an alternate-universe Far Far Away land where there is no Shrek, and Rumpelstiltskin reigns. There, Donkey spends his days hauling carts, and a portly Puss in Boots prefers lounging to swashbuckling.

Their moving, poetic tale is conveyed through the older Gian Luca's suave voiceover, combined with the lush, melodious sounds of its heady, tropical setting, peppered with a soundtrack of Phil Spector songs. -- (C) Official Site", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tabu_2012/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771305392", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 87, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 78}, "year": 2012, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "2153963"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2013-10-29", "theater": "2012-12-26"}}

According to many Islamic scripts and interpretations, photographic reproduction of any living being is Haram or forbidden. That means, obviously, television would also be 'Haram'. Accordingly, the Mutawalli of a Bangladeshi rural mosque declares Jihad against all kind of images- still or moving. Hence Television is also forbidden. From then on, we start experiencing a somewhat funny fight against a stupid box called television. At one end, we keep discovering people's ever growing crazy interest to watch television and their desperate efforts to fulfill that interest. At the other end, we see the Imam's relentless effort to keep the villagers away from, what he thought, 'sin'. But at the end of the film, 'Television', which he hated so much, comes to the rescue and helps the Imam reach a transcendental state where he and his God are unified.

The day he turns sixty-three, Virgil receives a phone call from a young woman who asks him to handle the disposal of some family works of art. But when the time comes for his first site visit, the girl fails to appear, nor, for various reasons, is she present for the taking of the inventory or for the transportation and restoration of the pieces.

And with this, the old antique dealer's life begins to take an unexpected turn. It is Robert who shows him, step-by-step, how to win the heart of a young woman who is afraid of the world and, caught in the middle of this puzzling game of chess, Virgil soon finds himself enveloped by a passion that will transform his grey existence forever.

They are forced to take on new additions to the family, learning what acceptance and empathy really mean.

Omar Metwally stars as Omar Razaghi, a young graduate student in the U.S. who wishes to author a biography on the late Jules Gund -- an enigmatic writer who spent his final years with his family in Uruguay, then committed suicide. Omar writes the Gund clan to request permission to pen the text, but is shocked and baffled by the family's refusal to comply. At the urging of Omar's forceful girlfriend, Dierdre (Alexandra Maria Lara), Omar books a seat about the next flight to Uruguay, visits the Gund enclave, and tries to persuade them to change their minds. Present are Gund's gay twin brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins), his widow Caroline (Laura Linney), his mistress Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and his young daughter by Arden, Portia (Ambar Mallman). Omar works on the family members one by one, but runs into extreme difficulty both with Caroline -- a hateful woman bearing deep-seated resentments, who initially refuses to comply with the project at all costs -- and with Adam, who agrees to participate on the condition that Omar perform a dangerous favor in return. Meanwhile, passions begin to stir between Omar and Arden, and Dierdre decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, The City of Your Final Destination received severely limited theatrical distribution, and failed to make much of a splash at the box office, despite favorable notices from a number of U.S. critics and Ivory's excellent track record. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/city_of_your_final_destination/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770681824/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770681824/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770681824.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770681824/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/86/11168671_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770681824", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 38, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 38}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "0896923"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-08-17", "theater": "2010-04-16"}}

Jeremy Brock has adapted the scr eenplay from Rosemary Sutcliff's classic novel The Eagle of the Ninth. In 140 AD, the Roman Empire extends all the way to Britain - though its grasp is incomplete, as the rebellious tribes of Caledonia (today's Scotland) hold sway in the far North. Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) arrives in Britain, determined to restore the tarnished reputation of his father, Flavius Aquila. It was 20 years earlier that Rome's 5,000-strong Ninth Legion, under the command of Flavius and carrying their golden emblem, the Eagle of the Ninth, marched north into Caledonia. They never returned; Legion and Eagle simply vanished into the mists. Angered, the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall to seal off the territory; Hadrian's Wall became the northernmost frontier of the Roman Empire - the edge of the known world. Driven to become a brilliant soldier and now given command of a small fort in the southwest, Marcus bravely leads his troops during a siege. Commended by Rome for his bravery, yet discharged from the army because of his severe wounds, Marcus convalesces, demoralized, in the villa of his Uncle Aquila (Donald Sutherland), a retired army man. When Marcus impulsively gets a young Briton's life spared at a gladiatorial contest, Aquila buys the Briton, Esca (Jamie Bell), to be Marcus' slave. Marcus is dismissive of Esca, who harbors a seething hatred of all things Roman. Yet Esca vows to serve the man who has saved his life. Hearing a rumor that the Eagle has been seen in a tribal temple in the far north, Marcus is galvanized into action, and sets off with Esca across Hadrian's Wall. But the highlands of Caledonia are a vast and savage wilderness, and Marcus must rely on his slave to navigate the region. When they encounter ex-Roman soldier Guern (Mark Strong), Marcus realizes that the mystery of his father's disappearance may well be linked to the secret of his own slave's identity and loyalty - a secret all the more pressing when the two come face-to-face with the warriors of the fearsome Seal Prince (Tahar Rahim).

Except on weekends, which he spends in the country with his family-gentle interludes, as precious as they are fragile. With his bearing and exceptional charisma, Gregoire commands admiration. He seems invincible. Yet his prestigious production company, Moon Films, is on its last legs. Too many productions, too many risks, too many debts. Storm clouds are gathering. But Gregoire ploughs on at all costs. Where will his blind obstinacy lead him? One day, he is obliged to face the facts. In one word: failure. He is overwhelmed by fatigue. Which soon, secretly, turns into despair.", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/father_of_my_children/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770853191/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770853191/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770853191.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770853191/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "Unrated", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/95/32/10953287_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/95/32/10953287_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/95/32/10953287_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/95/32/10953287_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770853191", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 91, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 60}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1356928"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-06-21", "theater": "2010-05-28"}}

As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles. -- (C) WB", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_great_gatsby_2013/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240552/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172588_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172588_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172588_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/25/11172588_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771240552", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 48, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 68}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2013, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1343092"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2013-08-27", "theater": "2013-05-10"}}

Bennett's death devastates his family: his mother, Grace (Susan Sarandon), is overcome with grief and can't stop wondering what his final minutes must have been like; father Allen (Pierce Brosnan) is forced to turn away from his mistress (Jennifer Ehle) and try to comfort a woman he's no longer certain he loves; and brother Ryan (Johnny Simmons) mourns Bennett while becoming painfully aware that he will never live up to his late brother's example in the eyes of his parents. As grief slowly brings the family's emotional troubles to the surface, two unwelcome characters come into the picture -- Rose, who has discovered she's pregnant with Bennett's child, and the truck driver (Michael Shannon) who unwittingly took Bennett's life.

Inspired by true events, the film follows seminary student Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue), who is sent to study exorcism at the Vatican in spite of his own doubts about the controversial practice and even his own faith.

Only when he's sent to apprentice with the unorthodox Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins)--a legendary priest who has performed thousands of exorcisms--does Michael's armor begin to fall. As he is drawn into a troubling case that seems to transcend even Father Lucas's skill, he begins to glimpse a phenomenon science can't explain or control...and an evil so violent and terrifying that it forces him to question everything he believes.

Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho, an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. There's nothing in Spy that the audience hasn't seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier), but, fans will appreciate director Brian Levant's homage to Jackie Chan's past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably, Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence, which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films.The main story centers on Bob's relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll), nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley), and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver, Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she's gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that's clearly over his head, Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch, GPS tracking, x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid's affection, but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family, Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly, there's a certain level of cheese in this film, especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains, Poldark (Magnus Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher), whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention, the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian, who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys, which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent, Glaze, and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob's BFF Colton James, who lends folksy witticisms like \"As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.\"Even so, Chan's charm wins out in the end, and The Spy Next Door's most effective sequences involve Bob's attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative, and the audience can't help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films, but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina O'Connor, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spy_next_door/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807290/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807290/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807290.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770807290/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "posters": {"profile": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178004_ori.jpg", "detailed": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178004_ori.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178004_ori.jpg", "original": "http://resizing.flixster.com/unsafe/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178004_ori.jpg"}, "id": "770807290", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 12, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 40}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1273678"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-05-18", "theater": "2010-01-15"}}

Tillman served a tour of duty in Iraq and was on patrol in Afghanistan when, on April 22, 2004, he was killed during a reconnaissance mission near the border of Pakistan. When word spread about Tillman's death, the Army issued a press release declaring he'd been shot down while trying to heroically block the fire of a band of Taliban insurgents. While the Army's story painted a glowing picture of the fallen soldier and athlete, some of the details sounded suspect to Tillman's family, and in time they began asking questions. As it happens, Tillman's parents were outspoken in their opposition to the war in Iraq, and after he had seen what was happening firsthand, so was Tillman, who had been a sharp student with an interest in politics during his college years. In time, Tillman's parents demanded an investigation into their son's death, and the testimony of several witnesses revealed that Tillman wasn't felled during an act of heroism -- his death was the result of \"friendly fire\" by men from his own company, shooting indiscriminately at an unknown target. Filmmaker Amir Bar-Lev examines Pat Tillman's unusual life and times, the facts about his death, how and why the military created a cover story to hide the truth, and his family's battle to bring the real story into the open in the documentary The Tillman Story, which received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_tillman_story/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874812/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874812/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874812.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874812/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/06/11120623_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/06/11120623_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/06/11120623_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/12/06/11120623_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770874812", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 93, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 91}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1568334"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-02-01", "theater": "2010-08-20"}}

Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life. -- (C) Fox Searchlight", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_tree_of_life_2011/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770793166/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770793166/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770793166.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770793166/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157220_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157220_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157220_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157220_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770793166", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 84, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 60}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2011, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "0478304"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2011-10-11", "theater": "2011-05-27"}}

Leon Bronstein (Jay Baruchel) is a young man who has made the discovery that his birth name is the same as that of Leon Trotsky, the celebrated Russian revolutionary and socialist theorist. This coincidence leads Leon to believe that he is the reincarnation of Trotsky and it is his destiny to follow his path as closely as possible -- which is a bit difficult when you have rich parents and attend an upscale private school in Montreal. Leon's father (Saul Rubinek) gives his son a part-time job in one of his clothing factories, and within a day Leon is leading his fellow workers in a sit-down strike. Father isn't amused and punishes Leon by making him attend public school, but there the world-be revolutionary finds new ways to battle fascism -- which in this case is represented by Principal Berkhoff (Colm Feore) and Mrs. Davis (Domini Blythe), a teacher eager to give her students detention. Leon's pursuit of social justice causes him to fall in with Frank (Michael Murphy), a burned-out activist-turned-college professor, but Leon also finds himself infatuated with Frank's current girlfriend -- who, like Trotsky's great love, is named Alexandra (Emily Hampshire) and is nine years older than he.

Director Jolie began shooting some of the most dramatic and challenging scenes on Wednesday, October 16, on location far out at sea in Moreton Bay, Australia, with Zamperini (O'Connell) and his fellow airmen-Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock)-having impossibly survived being adrift in the open Pacific for several weeks. Working with cameras on a floating rig in choppy waters and braving the elements, with actors dieting for months to appear as depleted as their characters, Jolie completed a successful first day of a location shoot that promises to be rigorous and uniquely challenging. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's (\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\") enormously popular book, Unbroken brings to the big screen Zamperini's unbelievable and inspiring true story about the resilient power of the human spirit. Starring alongside O'Connell, Gleeson and Wittrock are Garrett Hedlund and John Magaro as fellow POWs who find an unexpected camaraderie during their internment, Alex Russell as Zamperini's brother, Pete, and in his English-language feature debut, Japanese actor Miyavi as the brutal camp guard known only to the men as \"The Bird.\" The film is produced by Jolie, as well as Matthew Baer (City by the Sea), Erwin Stoff (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and Clayton Townsend (This Is 40).

At that time, a handful of Disney executives were questioning the wisdom of continuing to make animated films, as the company was making more money in live-action movies, theme parks, and television. That changed when Roy Disney -- Walt's nephew and the last figure from the studio's Golden Age management team still on board -- teamed up with newly hired studio executives Michael D. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg to restore their reputation for both quality and commercial appeal. With the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, the team sparked a new interest in animation on the big screen, and a string of smash hits that began with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast launched a new era of both acclaim and box-office success for the company. But those successes didn't come without behind-the-scenes conflict, and Don Hahn, a longtime producer at Disney, offers an inside look at the creative squabbles and battles amongst the management that came during Disney's climb back to the top of Hollywood's mountain in the documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty. Along with behind-the-scenes footage and rare personal artwork created by the studio's animation staff (including some unflattering cartoons of their bosses), the film includes interviews with many key figures of this era in Disney history, and several people who enjoyed greater success after leaving the company, such as Tim Burton and John Lasseter.

Having served eight years for securities fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, Gekko emerges from prison to find that his daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), prefers to remain estranged, and that his former Wall Street cohorts are still raking in the cash. Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore (LaBeouf), who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company's stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it's being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James (Josh Brolin), of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book \"Is Greed Good?\" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie's back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel's downfall. Later, as Jake begins plotting to avenge his mentor, Gekko starts to reveal his true colors. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_street_money_never_sleeps/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814365/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814365/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814365.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814365/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "posters": {"profile": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/31/11153128_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/31/11153128_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/31/11153128_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/31/11153128_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "770814365", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Rotten", "critics_score": 55, "audience_rating": "Spilled", "audience_score": 44}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2010, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1027718"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2010-12-21", "theater": "2010-09-24"}}

Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people.

Half-assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)--an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own--the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna.

Once there, however, he runs into Iris' sister Hannah (Rosemarie Dewitt) who is reeling from the abrupt end of a seven-year relationship and finds solace in Tom's unexpected presence. A blurry evening of drinking concludes with an awkward sexual incident, made worse by Iris' sudden presence at the cabin the next morning. A twisted tale of ever-complicated relationships is set in motion with raw, hilarious and emotional performances from the all-star cast. -- (C) IFC", "links": {"alternate": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/your_sisters_sister/", "reviews": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771251352/reviews.json", "similar": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771251352/similar.json", "self": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771251352.json", "cast": "http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771251352/cast.json"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "posters": {"profile": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/44/11164491_tmb.jpg", "detailed": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/44/11164491_tmb.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/44/11164491_tmb.jpg", "original": "http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/44/11164491_tmb.jpg"}, "id": "771251352", "ratings": {"critics_rating": "Certified Fresh", "critics_score": 83, "audience_rating": "Upright", "audience_score": 66}, "critics_consensus": "", "year": 2012, "alternate_ids": {"imdb": "1742336"}, "release_dates": {"dvd": "2012-11-06", "theater": "2012-06-15"}}
